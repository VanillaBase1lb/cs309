The Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) is an x86 assembler that uses the Intel syntax for MS-DOS and 
Microsoft Windows. Beginning with MASM 8.0, there are two versions of the assembler: One for 16-bit
& 32-bit assembly sources, and another (ML64) for 64-bit sources only. MASM is maintained by Microsoft,
but since version 6.12 it has not been sold as a separate product. It is instead supplied with various
Microsoft SDKs and C compilers. Recent versions of MASM are included with Microsoft Visual Studio.
The earliest versions of MASM were sold either as the generic "Microsoft Macro Assembler" for all 
x86 machines or as the OEM version specifically for IBM PCs. By Version 4.0, the IBM release was 
dropped. Up to Version 3.0, MASM was also bundled with a smaller companion assembler, ASM.EXE. This 
was intended for PCs with only 64k of memory and lacked some features of the full MASM, such as the 
ability to use code macros. 

MASM has never been softened or compromised into a consumer friendly tool and is designed to be used 
by professional programmers for operating system level code and high performance object modules, executable 
files and dynamic link libraries.

The latest Version currently working is The MASM32 SDK version 11.


We may also Use NASM instead of MASM.NASM is an asssembler for the x86 CPU architecture portable to nearly every
modern platform, and with code generation for many platforms old and new. The Netwide Assembler (NASM) is an 
assembler and disassembler for the Intel x86 architecture. It can be used to write 16-bit, 32-bit (IA-32) and 
64-bit (x86-64) programs. NASM is considered to be one of the most popular assemblers for Linux. But we can use
it on Windows based systems too.
