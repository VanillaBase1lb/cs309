MASM stands for Microsoft Macro Assembler. It's used on 
Computing ,Programming and Development Worldwide. The 
Microsoft Macro Assembler is an x86 assembler that uses
 the Intel syntax for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows. The
MASM 32 Project is true freeware written by programmers
for programmers so that they can realise the full power
of the Windows Operating System without being subject
 to any additional conditions or external interests.
The latest Version of MASM currently working is The 
MASM32 SDK version 11. The Microsoft Macro Assembler
 (MASM) provides several advantages over inline 
 assembly. MASM contains a macro language that has 
features such as looping, arithmetic, and text 
string processing. MASM is also advantageous as 
it gives more control over the Hardware as it 
supports 386,486 and pentium processors. It is written
 by programmers for programmers so that they can 
 realise the full power of the Windows Operating 
 System without being subject to any additional 
 conditions or external interests. It a freeware.
MASM has never been softened or compromised into
a consumer friendly tool and is designed to be
 used by professional programmers for operating
  system level code and high performance object 
modules, executable files and dynamic link libraries.
We may also Use NASM instead of MASM.NASM is 
an asssembler for the x86 CPU architecture 
portable to nearly every modern platform, and 
with code generation for many platforms old and
 new. The Netwide Assembler (NASM) is an assembler
 and disassembler for the Intel x86 architecture.
  It can be used to write 16-bit, 32-bit (IA-32) and 
64-bit (x86-64) programs. NASM is considered to be 
one of the most popular assemblers for Linux. But 
we can use it on Windows based systems too.
